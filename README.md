# Stenomod Case

Designing a 3D-printed case for the Stenomod

## Stenomod

What is the Stenomod? Charley Shattuck's affordable portable steno machine. Available for purchase from the [Stenomod Blog](http://stenomod.blogspot.com/) for around $200 USD.

It comes on a deck of wood with G20 keycaps. While workable, there are some concerns about the exposed PCB. I'm hoping to offer a 3D-printed case for using the Stenomod in a split configuration.

## Logo

stenomod.svg is the logo that I made while waiting for my Stenomod to arrive. I'd like to license it as MIT so that anyone can use it for any purpose.

## Case

The case is two parts per hand, and should hold the PCB quite snug. The screw holes are just to be passed through with a screw and a bolt, you can put rubber feet on the bottom to avoid standing on the screws. Perhaps someone smarter than me can figure out how to make a design with flush screws, but this was my first from-scratch 3D project so I took the easiest route.

To export the case from the SCAD, there are a few variables near the bottom that let you change between the four parts as well as a preview to see what each hand looks like assembled.

The case is licensed as MIT -- I don't really care what it gets used for (you can sell them if you want.)

## Key Caps

In addition to the case, I've also been working on 3D printed steno key caps. These are not specific to the Stenomod, other than the fact that I am developing them with the Stenomod. Users of other matrix-layout keyboards could print and use these keys just as easily.

I used the very helpful [Parametric Key Cap](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:468651) key.stl file from rsheldiii to make my steno keycaps. There wasn't much work involved, only adding a custom profile and some lettering!

The license for the key caps is the same as the Parametric Key Cap, CC SA w attribution and non-commercial use.

The license for the repository is MIT, unless otherwise stated (as in the key caps, which carry a more restrictive license due to them being a fork of another project).
